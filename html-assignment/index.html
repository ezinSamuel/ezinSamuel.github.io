        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Samuel, and I’m currently studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. I’ve always been fascinated by technology and creativity, which is why I chose this field. Designing and coding allow me to bring ideas to life, and I enjoy the challenge of solving problems through digital media.</p>

        <p>I’m originally from <abbr title="Your Country">Nigeria</abbr> and speak <em>English</em>. I love learning new things and always look for opportunities to improve myself. I also value deep conversations and meaningful connections—if something doesn’t interest me, I tend to tune out quickly.</p>

        <p>In addition to coding, I enjoy exploring web development, UI/UX design, and multimedia creation. In my free time, I stay active, work out, and experiment with new tech tools. I believe that growth comes from continuous learning, so I always push myself to practice, explore, and refine my skills.</p>
