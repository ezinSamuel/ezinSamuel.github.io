            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
               My name is Samuel, and I am currently studying interactive media design at Algoquin College. I have a strong passion for web development and enjoy working with both design and coding aspects. Orginally from <abbr title="Kenya">KE</abbr>.I speak<em>Swahili</em>and English. My backgroud in photography and digital art has helped me develop a keen eye for details and aesthetics.</p>
               <p>I love experimenting with different design tools and frameworks to create engaging user experiences. Outside of school, I like to enjoy hiking, playing guitar and exploring new cultures through travel. I beleive that storytelling through design is a powerful way to connect with people, and I hope to use my skills to create meaningful digital experiences.
